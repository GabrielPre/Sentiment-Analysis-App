# **Project Management**
We chose Notion for our project management because some of us had a great experience using this tool as it implement various features from many productivity tools on the market.

We divided the project in Milestones and Tasks that are part of thoses Milestones.
## **Milestones**
This was our main view with the state of our tasks, the tasks associated with a progress bar that's a custom function based on the completition of the tasks.
